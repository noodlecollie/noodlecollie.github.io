This is adapted from an old page I found where I was attempting to write a driver for Windows 9x. I thought that the notes on the 86Box setup might be useful to refer to in future.

## Original Page

I'm going to set up a Windows 95/98 VM using [86Box](https://github.com/86Box/86Box), so that I have something to easily write the driver on. Hypervisors like VirtualBox don't seem to support old versions of Windows that well, and the development version of 86Box [also has support](https://github.com/86Box/86Box/pull/1382) for arguably pointless but extremely cool shader effects (eg. [libretro](https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders)) that increase nostalgia, so I thought it would be a good idea to record the setup procedure for the VM here too.

## 86Box Setup

First, download the [experimental version of 86Box](http://ci.86box.net/job/86Box-Dev) for your host platform, and extract it somewhere. You may also want to get the latest [86box Manager](https://github.com/86Box/86BoxManager/releases) for easier management of VMs (this page assumes that you do have it).

I'll be honest, I don't know very much about the different variants of hardware that 86Box supports, and which ones are more appropriate than others for Windows 95 and Windows 98, but I'll list the setup that I have. This was taken and adapted from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgMKUezEEqk) on setting up Windows 95 in 86box.

It is almost certainly possible that faster hardware could be used here in order to make the VM quicker.

## Installing Windows

To install Windows 98, you'll need an installation ISO and a bootable floppy disk image. Unfortunately, the standard bootable image doesn't seem to recognise the CD drive in 86Box, so the installation video referenced above uses [one with extra drivers](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0kyZzd3dWQtMDlmOEdRcE1VZXFZWFZtRWZYd3xBQ3Jtc0tudFVNTXg4STV3UE1say05OURnTl9qM09Md1llM3pmdXdHcncxR0FYM0RNeV8xUGVuMWdaMXlNbnlYWEVUMG5iQnJvNHNUZmhfREdsT2hfZE1jZHVLNE5odHA5cFJQblpDTW90ek1CU0ZmaFFPMDNWdw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F184aWqbJb4MUU3Yy9cAY1k7r1Y3Nyi_R3%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing).
