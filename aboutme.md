My name's Jonathan Poncelet, but I often go by Vesper or NoodleCollie online. If you've known me for a good while, you might also remember me as x6herbius, but I eventually fell out of love with that handle I'd made as an early teenager.

I've been a furry since 2010, with my two primary fursonas being an ermine called Vesper (sometimes affectionately referred to as "a noodle"), and a border collie called Maple. Combine these two together and you get my current online handle!

I do a lot of programming, gaming, music, and occasionally artwork or photography. If you want to know more, check out my [links page](https://noodlecollie.carrd.co).
